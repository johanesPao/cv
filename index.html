        <h2>Hello</h2>
        <p>
          My name is Johanes Indra Pradana Pao. People called me
          <strong>Pao</strong> for simplicity. I was born in Jakarta, March 3rd,
          1985.
        </p>
        <p>
          I'm currently working as a <strong>senior business analyst</strong> in
          a retail company and I self-taught myself with programming in my free
          time. I'm also aiming to be a
          <strong>full-stack developer</strong> using mostly
          <em>Javascript</em> and <em>Java</em>.

          <h3>Corporate Finance</h3>

            With background education in Financial Management and past working
            experiences as Financial Analyst in PT Insight Investment (2009 -

          <h3>Microsoft Excel</h3>
          <p>
            I extensively use Microsoft Excel in day-to-day activity. My
            competency in Excel can be considered as advanced and I use Excel in
            conjunction with other tools or software such as Database,
            PowerQuery, PowerPivot and also Visual Basic for Application (VBA).

          <h3>Power BI</h3>
          <p>
            My encounter with Power BI hasn't been that long, however I have
            adapted very well with how Power BI works and I have also learned M
            Language that was used in Power BI. I have successfully generate
            multiple interactive reports from multiple datasource.

          <h3>SQL</h3>
          <p>
            I'm experienced with any kind of SQL, be it traditional SQL (MySQL,
            Microsoft SQL Server, PostgreSQL) or the latest NoSQL (MongoDB and
            Firebase).

          <h3>Javascript</h3>
          <p>
            My experience with javascript also hasn't been that long, but I've
            studied intensively for this topic lately. I've taken multiple
            courses in javascript and also starting to develop using Node.js,
            Express, React and React-Native.

          <h3>Java</h3>
          <p>
            I've known and learnt Java when I was in college, but lately I've
            started to use it extensively in order to develop android
            application using Java native.

          <p>
            I've built a couple of web based and mobile based application in the
            past. A web based application for Koperasi and an android
            application named Kelontong is under development.

        <h2>Stay In Touch</h2>
        <h3>What matters in life is....</h3>
        <p>
          To keep on improving yourself. Keep studying and becoming more and
          more for yourself. Once you stop improving, your life means nothing
          but an empty road just waiting to meet its end.
